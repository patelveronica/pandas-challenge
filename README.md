PyCitySchools Analysis

There are 15 District and Charter schools in this dataset with total of 39,170 students and budget of $24,649,428.00. Each school has average per student spending budget of $620.00.
Based on the dataset, Charter schools has 90% overall passing rate compared to District schools with less than 55% overall passing rate. Overall passing rate could be indication of size of the school. Charter Schools size is lot smaller than District schools. Average budget per students were about same in both schoolâ€™s system. It seems that schools with less than $584.00 per student budget, the Overall Passing rate was lot higher than schools who has $650.00 per student budget.
Lastly, smaller (<1000) and medium (1000-2000) size schools overall passing rate is 90% than larger (2000-5000) schools with 57% overall passing rate. I would pick smaller or medium schools for my kids.

Thank you,
